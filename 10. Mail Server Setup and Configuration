HOW MAIL SERVER WORKS
Ayşe client -----------------------------> ayse@abc.com.tr
SMTP SMTPS email server does some checks

mail.abc.com.tr ------------------------> DNS

mail.abc.com.tr ------------------------> posta.xyz.ed.tr
SMTP SMTPS

DNS <------------------------ posta.xyz.ed.tr
SPF checks (Reverse proxy checks, singular threads for abc.com.tr)


posta.xyz.ed.tr ---------------------> RBL control (Black or not is checking it)

posta.xyz.ed.tr -> Gray checks the list, is it a robot or not, go 2 min. come later.
Are you really a mail server or a bot? 69

posta.xyz.ed.tr -> Header checks, time, sender information, etc.
posta.xyz.ed.tr -> Body check, content information control, word control etc.
posta.xyz.ed.tr -> Makes content security,
Anti spam - used to analyze email and give rating points. Span looks assassin, DSS looks, Radon looks
Accordingly, it thinks that it is spam, manipulates the subject and delivers it to the user.
Anti virus - But if there is a virus in the mail, it can drop directly.

Mail is then sent to the user's home file, but the user's outlook has not yet been dropped.

Then when I say send to the user via outlook, outlook a POP3, IMAP protocols mail drops.


In the IMAP protocol, the mails stop on the server. In this way, it works synchronously with the mail server.

If using IMAP, for example, the incoming mail is received from both mobile phone and ipad at the same time.

When we use IMAP and send an e-mail with Ipada, for example, we can use Outlook server to drop the items on our mobile phone.
must be set to sync.


DKIM -> Send the public key to the server on the other party, sign it with its private key and send it.

Client

When sending eMAIL, you can contact directly with postfix. Postfix sends the email and sends a copy of the dovecot.

To run a mail server
1. Having FQDN Fully Qualified Domain Name
2. To be able to connect from the 25th port to the outside.
3. Having the right time. The timing server is important
4. Syslog -> It needs to be a logging system.

rsyslog configuration
vim /etc/rsyslogd/xxx.conf
mail. * - / var / log / mail.log / mail -> - it enables the service to continue without writing to disk and the operating system to write a tooth in the next euphrates. In systems that produce multiple logs, it can wait for the write service to disk.

auth, authpriv. * /var/log/auth.log
4. Must have MX record
5. A record
6. Reverse proxy registration should be available.

SMTP -> You accept the mail or reject it completely.
LMTP -> I send mail from one person to three. It can accept or reject the difference from SMTP on a person basis. Used when sending mail from LMTP postfix to Dovecat. In this way, person / accept / deny can be done. SMTP is used when sending mail via internet.

SMTP is a half duplex prtole. He tells himself, he listens against him, he tells him against him.

Postfix on a stand-alone Internet host -> Can send and receive mail on the Internet side.
Postfix on a null client -> Sends only mail, not receiving mail, for example, servers can be installed.
Postfix on a local network -> We send mail in the local network, we cannot send mail by the internet.
Postfix email firewall / gateway -> is set up to set up postfix in front of the exchange and to check postfix e-mail.

etc / dovecot / conf.d / 10-mail.conf

mail_location = maildir: ~ / .mail.dir -> Mbox, mail, these are mail retention formats. We want to keep it in a mail format. With this mail location, when dovecot gets up, we show you where the mails are.

Which user I will use the service created in his home directory as follows:
root @ server: ~ # mkdir ./maildir

We made the following changes.
vim /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
