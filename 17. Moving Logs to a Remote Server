GrayLog is about logging

It is recommended to install a minimum of 3 nodes.

GrayLog itself comes with MongoDb.
It is useful to do it without virtualization for GrayLog. Here it is on 6 machines.
Here, full text searches are not performed on Mongolar, searches are made with Elastic Search.


ElasticSearch1 <----------> Gray1 Mongo

ElasticSearch1 <----------> Gray2 Mongo

ElasticSearch1 <----------> Gray3 Mongo

We can keep the Log of the application, the Log of the Operating System, the Database or even the queries in the Database. It is integrated with Grafana.
