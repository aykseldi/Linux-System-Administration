Linux From Scratch: Completing your own Linux Machine according to your needs
It is a project aiming to stand up.
Linux from Scratch -> Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step
instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.

Linux Version Numbering

App major minor
Debian 4 19

There are 2 types of applications on our Linux computer;
1. Binary applications compiled and embedded in the kernel1 -
2. There are applications that are compiled but not embedded in the kernel but still remain in the file system.

What is XFS File System?
XFS is a file system.
XFS is a robust and highly-scalable single host 64-bit journaling file system.
It is entirely extent-based, so it supports very large file and file system sizes.
The maximum supported file system size in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 and later is 300 TB.
The maximum supported XFS file system size in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 and earlier is 100 TB.
The number of files an XFS system can hold is limited only by the space available in the
file system.
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/performance_tuning_guide/s-storage-xfs
In Red-Hats, XFS File system is used to mount the kernel while the system is starting up.

What happens when I create a file?
like touch grandpa. What do I do to share a file with other people.
The most convenient method for file sharing is FTP.
Share a file via WindowsNetBios Protocol (-> Samba -> TCP 139)
used.
However, Samba is a vulnerable protocol.



S-ATA -> Serial Advanced Technology Attachment
SCSI -> Small Computer System Interface


There are protocols that enable disks to communicate with the motherboard.
Disks output process SCSI -> IDE -> P-ATA -> SATA -> SAS
6 GB / s
If we have the first 4 types of disks, such as SCSI, IDE, P-ATA, SATA, an FTP server on them
if there is a slow reading speed from disk, whatever our network output speed
a proper service cannot be provided.

What is Liderahenk?
Unlimited number of different systems and users on the corporate network from one center
developed by TÜBİTAK ULAKBİM, which enables to manage, monitor and control
is an open source software system.

How do I know the release I use?
root @ client: / lib / modules # cat / etc / debian_version
10.0


Kickstart - Red Hat
By creating one configuration file, more than one (many) servers can be installed with this configuration.
This system can be used for both managing and recording.
we can search gray log with -> elastic search.

What is Unix Socket?

Each layer can know and detect its own data. As you go up in the layers,
each layer can be blocked with if conditions according to its own area.

App Application firewall -> Application-specific blocking rules can be written.

127.0.0.1 Loop-back interface - TCP / Ip configuration is correct on the operating system side
If it works, we can communicate with loopback ip.
We use the Tcp stack while communicating in this way within myself.
Tcp speech protocol syn, syn-ack is applied wherever we use tcp and this is an overhead
creates.

Interpreted languages ​​- code is not compiled, it speaks through the compiler. like php, python


Apachi -> Mod_Php - >> Php
Apachi corresponds with php and mod_php. The mod interprets php php.



Unix socket speaks with its own socket mechanism.
He speaks very fast because he doesn't have Overhead. Unix socket works only on our own machine (locally).


Database --- Unix Socket --- php-fdm ------- Unix Socket --- Nginx ----------> TCP

If I have 2 dockers on the same machine, I can replace them with Tcp.
Speaking on the Unix socket provides a lot of performance.
