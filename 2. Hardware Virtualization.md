# Hardware Virtualization 

## Virtualization Manager


**What is Hardware Virtualization?**

All sources of hardware are controlled by Hypervisor. 
  * Type 1 is Virtualization. If hypervisor does not work, virtual machines will not work as well.
It comes with a type 1 hypervisor setup program. (It works itself) Hypervisor is not an operating system. We can install a virtual machine on it and then install an operating system. 
**Vmware ESXI, Oracle VM, XEN**

  * Tip2 Hypervisor works on the hardware.
  The hypervisor works on it and the virtual machines are installed on the hypervisor. The operating system controls the system resources. 
  **VirtualBox, Hyper-V, Vmware WorkStation**
  As a side note: *Linux Kernel  Linux Kernel acts as a hypervisor itself.*

    1. Isolation 
    *Whether AMD or Intel Cpu can be installed. It isolates the source of the virtual machine from a physical source.*
    2. Source sharing
    3. Source standardization  (Vertical Isolation)

*If there is no need for source standardization and just an isolation is needed, then Process Virtualizatrion (Isolation) can be achieved using cgroups.*

**Some Virtualization Systems**
* LXC - >> (Linux Containers)
* Docker
* Openv2
* Solaris Zones (1970)

 ## LXC Setup and Configuration
 
We start with installing LXC first.
```shell
sudo apt install lxc
```shell

Enter the following parameters into lxc network configuration  file.

```shell
aty@ debian: # cat / etc / default / lxc-net
USE_LXC_BRIDG to = "true"
LXC_BRIDG to = "lxcbr0"
LXC_ADD R = "10.0.10.1"
LXC_NETMASK = "255.255.255.0"
LXC_NETWORK = "10.0.10.0/24"
LXC_DHCP_RANG to = "10.0.10.2,10.0.10.254"
root @ debian: #
```

Then restart service LXC-Net
```shell
aty@ debian: # systemctl restart lxc-net
```

It shows the DHCP process and information that LXC has installed.

```shell
aty@debian: # ps fauxwww | grep dnsmasq
aty 11578 0.0 0.0 6076 888 pts / 2 S + 03:22 0:00 | \ _ grep dnsmasq
dnsmasq 11570 0.0 0.0 18012 352? S 03:20 0:00 dnsmasq -u dnsmasq --strict-order --bind-interfaces --pid-file = / run / lxc / dnsmasq.pid --listen-address 10.0.10.1 --dhcp-range 10.0. 10.2,10.0.10.254 --dhcp-lease-max = 253 --dhcp-no-override --except-interface = lo --interface = lxcbr0 --dhcp-leasefile = / var / lib / misc / dnsmasq.lxcbr0. leases --dhcp-authoritative
```

```shell
aty @ debian: # ip link
8: lxcbr0: <NO-CARRIER, BROADCAST, MULTICAST, UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link / ether 00: 16: 3e: 00: 00: 00 brd ff: ff: ff: ff: ff: ff
  ```
  
The following commune shows the container list

```shell
aty@ debian: # lxc-ls -> Shows container list
debian01
```

We can also connect to the container from the console.

```shell
aty@ debian: / var / lib / lxc / debian01 # lxc-console -n debian01
```

We can see the status of virtual machine with fancy parameter.

```shell
root @ debian: # lxc-ls --fancy
NAME STATE AUTOSTART GROUPS IPV4 IPV6 UNPRIVILEGED
debian01 RUNNING 0 - - - false
```

The working container is stopped.

```shell
aty@ debian: / sys / fs / cgroup / memory / mem01 # lxc-stop --name debian01
```


  The main directory of the LXC is below.
**/var/lib/lxc/debian01/rootfs/**

Now start the container again. 

```shell
aty @ debian: # lxc-start --name debian01
aty @ debian: # lxc-attach --name debian01
```

Create a file in the container

```shell
aty@debian01: ~ # touch /experiment.txt - >> \ I created a file in the container
```

 Create a file outside of containe with attach command.
 
```shell
aty@debian: ~ # lxc-attach --name debian01 - touch /deneme01.txt
```



We can also run commands from outside the container. If we don't type command than it will run bash directly.

*lxc-attach --name debian01 - touch /deneme01.txt*

We installed the iputils package in the container

```shell
aty@debian01:~# apt install  psmisc iputils-ping
aty@debian01:~# apt install  procps
```
If run ps command from the container, it only sees its own processes.

*ps fauxwww -*


For example, we can create a file for each container for lxc and virtual machine under it. In this way, we can set each container as 1 GB of mem or restrict all containers to 10 GB of ram in total.


*/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/lxc/debian01*  


### LXC Images

**So where does lxc-create -n debian01 -download get the container image from?**

```shell
 aty@debian:/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/lxc/debian01$ cd  /usr/share/lxc/templates/   
 aty@debian:/usr/share/lxc/templates$ ls -la
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 18155 Apr 14 09:46 lxc-download
```

The answer for this is above. It takes image configuration from lxc-download file. The download file has the required configuration for the container.

When we issue the command to  download LXC image, it downloads the following files to cache. When we run LXC destroy command, cache does not get infected, only the file under 
**var/lib/lxc/container_name**  is deleted.


```shell
aty@debian:/var/cache/lxc/download/debian/buster/amd64/default$ pwd
/var/cache/lxc/download/debian/buster/amd64/default
aty@debian:/var/cache/lxc/download/debian/buster/amd64/default$ ls -la
total 85644
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 Jul 20 18:48 .

We can move our lxc container from our machine to another linux machine
We can do this by moving the file **/var/lib/lxc/container_name.**

There are scripts such as centos, ubuntu in the **/usr/share/lxc/templates**
folder and we can set up ubuntu container by passing these parameters. However, if we want to establish a centos image on debian container, we need to install yum on debian. The important thing here is that the lxc versions must be same for another machine that we will move our virtual machine.

**/usr/share/lxc/templates**


The config file of the container. If I am going to carry a container to another machine, I have to look at this file.

root @ debian: / var / lib / lxc / debian01 # man lxc.container.conf
- >> In the file, it writes in detail the setting parameters and how to export them.

https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/manpages/man5/lxc.container.conf.5.html

root @ debian: ~ # cd / var / lib / lxc / debian01 /
root @ debian: / var / lib / lxc / debian01 # more config
# Template used to create this container: / usr / share / lxc / templates / lxc-download
# Parameters passed to the template:
# Template script checksum (SHA-1): 273c51343604eb85f7e294c8da0a5eb769d648f3
# For additional config options, please look at lxc.container.conf (5)

# Uncomment the following line to support nesting containers:
# lxc.include = /usr/share/lxc/config/nesting.conf
# (Be aware this has security implications)


# Distribution configuration
lxc.include = /usr/share/lxc/config/common.conf
lxc.arch = linux64

# Container specific configuration
lxc.apparmor.profile = generated
lxc.apparmor.allow_nesting = 1
lxc.rootfs.path = dir: / var / lib / lxc / debian01 / rootfs
lxc.uts.name = debian01

# Network configuration
lxc.net.0.type = veth
lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
lxc.net.0.flags = up

The following file can be restricted to all containers in common, but if we consider the container to its own conff file, this common file will be override.
/usr/share/lxc/config/common.conf
The container can be restricted in what it can do itself.

  LXC or Docker?
How many applications will work in the container? If more than one application will run, LXC makes sense, but if only one application will run, Docker makes more sense.
When we make ps -fe in the container, we see that many processes are running.
