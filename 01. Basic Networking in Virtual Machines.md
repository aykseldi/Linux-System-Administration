# Basic Networking in Virtual Machines


## Creating Bridge  Adding Interface On Linux Machine

### What is Veth?
It means **virtual eth**. It works in two ways. So, by veth we can securely connect **2** machines.

However, **veth** can only connect 2 machines to each other, it cannot connect more machines to each other. This is a constraint of veth.

> What if we want to connect 5 machines together?

**Bridge** structure has been developed to solve this problem.

*Bridge is actually a container*. Other devices placed in the bridge device can talk to each other.

**In other words, biridge device can be considered as a kind of physical ethernet switch.*

### Creating Bridge and Adding a Device in Bridge

#### Adding a Bridge

```shell
[aty @ localhost ~] # brctl show - >> Before adding
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces
[ @ localhost ~] # brctl addbr bridge0 - >> Add command
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl show
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces
bridge0 8000.000000000000 no - >> Added bridge device
```

#### Adding and Configuring an Interface  

We have added an interface named dummy0 and dummy1 with the command below and put them under bridge0.

```shell
[aty @ localhost ~] ip link add dummy1 type dummy
6: dummy0: <BROADCAST, NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link / ether 1a: 65: 2e: 30: 7b: 2c brd ff: ff: ff: ff: ff: ff
7: dummy1: <BROADCAST, NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link / ether 6a: 3b: 8d: f5: 25: f4 brd ff: ff: ff: ff: ff: ff
```shell

[aty @ localhost ~] # brctl addif bridge0 dummy0
[aty @ localhost ~] # brctl addif bridge0 dummy1
[aty @ localhost ~] # brctl show
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces
bridge0 8000.1a652e307b2c no dummy0
dummy1
```
When we gave the ip link command, we saw that dummy0 and dummy1 were down. That's why we made 2 interfaces up with the command below.

```shell
[aty @ localhost ~] # ip link set dummy0 up
[aty @ localhost ~] # ip link set dummy1 up
```

Now we are listeninng  requests from dummy0 but nothing came yet.

```shell
[aty @ localhost ~] # tcpdump -i dummy0

```


Give ip addresses to dummy0 and dummy1 .

```shell
[aty @ localhost ~] # ip address add 10.0.5.5/24 dev dummy0
[aty @ localhost ~] # ip address add 10.0.5.6/24 dev dummy1
```

Ping to the IP address of 10.0.5.6 using Dummy0

```shell
ping -I dummy0 10.0.5.6 - >> Send ping to the IP address of 10.0.5.6 using Dummy0

tcpdump -i dummy0 - >> we listen to requests for dummy0.
```


####  Setting Up  Bridge and Ip Link 


If we want to communicate virtual machines on 2 physical machines; The ethernet card to which the physical machines will be connected must be wired, this process cannot be done with the wireless ethernet cards.
We put a physical network card in the bridge, then we connect these network cards via the switch.
**Open V Switch** is used for further needs.

```shell
[aty @ localhost ~] # ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
[aty @ localhost ~] # ip link add veth2 type veth peer name veth3
[aty @ localhost ~] # brctl addif bridge0 veth2
```

```shell
ip link set bridge0 up
ip addr add 10.0.5.1/24 dev bridge0 - >>> we also gave the rope to the bridge.
tcpdump -i bridge0 - >> We listened to Bridge with tcpdump.
```
