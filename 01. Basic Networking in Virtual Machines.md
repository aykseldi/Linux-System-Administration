CREATE IDGE, ADD INTERFACE

   What is Veth?
It means virtual eth. It works in pairs. In this case, it securely connects 2 machines.
However, it can only connect 2 machines to each other, it cannot connect more machines to each other. This is a constraint of veth.
What if we want to connect 5 machines together?
Bridge structure has been developed to solve this problem.
Bridge is actually a container. Other devices placed in the Bridge device can talk to each other.
In other words, biridge device can be considered as a kind of physical ethernet switch.

  Adding Bridge and Defining a Device in Bridge

Adding a Bridge
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl show - >> Before adding
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl addbr bridge0 - >> Add command
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl show
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces
bridge0 8000.000000000000 no - >> Added bridge device

    Adding Interface
We have added an interface named dummy0 and dummy1 with the command below and put them under bridge0.

ip link add dummy1 type dummy
6: dummy0: <BROADCAST, NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link / ether 1a: 65: 2e: 30: 7b: 2c brd ff: ff: ff: ff: ff: ff
7: dummy1: <BROADCAST, NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link / ether 6a: 3b: 8d: f5: 25: f4 brd ff: ff: ff: ff: ff: ff

[root @ localhost ~] # brctl addif bridge0 dummy0
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl addif bridge0 dummy1
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl show
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces
bridge0 8000.1a652e307b2c no dummy0
                                                        dummy1

When we gave the ip link command, we saw that dummy0 and dummy1 were down. That's why we made 2 interfaces up with the command below.

[root @ localhost ~] # ip link set dummy0 up
[root @ localhost ~] # ip link set dummy1 up

[root @ localhost ~] # tcpdump -i dummy0
We listen to requests from dummy0 but nothing came

We gave the dummy0 and dummy1 ip addresses.

[root @ localhost ~] # ip address add 10.0.5.5/24 dev dummy0
[root @ localhost ~] # ip address add 10.0.5.6/24 dev dummy1

ping -I dummy0 10.0.5.6 - >> Send ping to the IP address of 10.0.5.6 using Dummy0

tcpdump -i dummy0 - >> we listen to requests for dummy0.


Another Example

[root @ localhost ~] # ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
[root @ localhost ~] # ip link add veth2 type veth peer name veth3
[root @ localhost ~] # brctl addif bridge0 veth2

  Bridge or Ip Link Stand Up
ip link set bridge0 up
ip addr add 10.0.5.1/24 dev bridge0 - >>> we also gave the rope to the bridge.
tcpdump -i bridge0 - >> We listened to Bridge with tcpdump.

If we want to communicate virtual machines on 2 physical machines; The ethernet card to which the physical machines will be connected must be wired, this process cannot be done with the wireless ethernet card.
We put a physical network card in the bridge, then we communicate these network cards via the switch.
Open V Switch is used for further needs.
