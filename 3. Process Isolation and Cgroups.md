# Process Isolation and Cgroups

## What are Cgroups?

It is called Control Groups as long. It is a feature of the Linux kernel that helps to limit and isolate the usage of resources such as processor, system memory, network, bandwidth by clustering processes. 

Using Cgroups, system administrators can prioritize tasks and users between each other and make the use of system resources more efficient.

We can list the objects that we can control on the control groups as follows.

```shell
[aty@ localhost ~] #sudo  ll /sys/fs/cgroup/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 blkio
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 11 Jul 20 04:03 cpu -> cpu, cpuacct
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 11 Jul 20 04:03 cpuacct -> cpu, cpuacct
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 cpu, cpuacct
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 cpuset
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 devices
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 freezer
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 hugetlb
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 memory
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Jul 20 04:03 net_cls -> net_cls, net_prio
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 net_cls, net_prio
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Jul 20 04:03 net_prio -> net_cls, net_prio
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 perf_event
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 pids
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 0 Jul 20 04:03 systemd

```

## Cgroup Components

* blkio - >> It can limit how much data a process can read and write per second.
It controls access of running processes to io devices. Hard Disk is meant from io or block devices. In other words, how fast a process can read and write data from disk can be controlled from blkio.

* cpu - >> It may limit the amount of cpu the process can use.

* cpuset - >>  We can change which CPUs the process can work on, or on which CPU process is working at that time.

memory - >> Displays and restricts the amount of ram and swap that the process csn use.

freezer - >> It can start and stop the process. The pause of virtual machines is done by this method.

## Libcgroup-Tools Package

We have installed this package in order to manage cgroups more easily.

```shell
[aty@localhost cgroup] # sudo yum install libcgroup-tools
```

Indicates in which cpu's processes are running.

```shell
[aty@localhost cpuset] # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus
0
```

 Since the Centos repo is old, we set up the epel repo.
 
 ```shell
 yum install -y epel-release
 ```
 
 ## Stress Package
 
 We installed the stress package to create a virtual load on a machine.
 
 ```shell
 yum install -y stress
  ```
  
  ```shell
 stress -c 1 - >> I gave 1 because there is only one CPU in my machine.
 ```
 
 Stress created 1 process that uses 100% of the CPU. We can see it from top command. 
 
 ```shell
 top - 06:03:53 up 2:00, 6 users, load average: 0.98, 0.50, 0.23
Tasks: 113 total, 3 running, 110 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie
-->> Cpu0: 100.0 us, 0.0 sy, 0.0 ni, 0.0 id, 0.0 wa, 0.0 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st
KiB Mem: 1014972 total, 522044 free, 128716 used, 364212 buff / cache
KiB Swap: 1134588 total, 1134588 free, 0 used. 707576 avail Mem

The reason why it can use all cpu in this way is cpu

  PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S% CPU% MEM TIME + COMMAND
12500 aty 20 0 7 308 100 0 R 92.4 0.0 1: 45.17 stress

```

## Creating a Cgroup Child Object
  
Under the cgroupfolder, we created a subgroup under the cpuset directory named *"deneme"*, where we can set up a limit for cpu usage. The *"deneme"* group inherits the settings in the parent directory.

```shell
cgcreate -g cpuset:/deneme
```

We created a group called an *"deneme"* under the /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset directory.

Each control group operates hierarchically within itself. When we create a test group in the cpuset directory, they use the default values from in the parent directory.


Values in the main  directory for  **Cpuset.cpu -> 0 1** 

The same occurs by default in the test directory. However, as we go down to the subdirectory, we can enter different restrictions. So we can arrange to use 1 cpu instead of 2 cpu.

```shell
echo "0" | tee /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/deneme/cpuset.cpus
```

Above we restricted the cpuset.cpus part in the experiment to use the first cpu.

```shell
[aty@localhost deneme] # echo "0" | tee /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/deneme/cpuset.mems
0
```

```shell
[aty@localhost deneme] # more cpuset.mems
0
```

We can say which processes will be included in this cgroup in the task file. Process id must be given here.

For example, if we export the bash process into the experiment cgroup, the bash process will create other processes in the *"deneme"* cgroup.
 
 
 ```shell
 echo $$ - >> Returns the id of the Bash process
 ```
 Reources can be isolated from each other as well as they can be restricted. These are also done through cgroups. 
 
If we create a directory under /sys/fs/cgroup/memory , it prepares the necessary files by itself.

With the command below, the bash process will run in the memory subdirectory named mem01.

 ```shell
aty@debian: / sys / fs / cgroup / memory / mem01 # echo $$ | tee / sys / fs / cgroup / memory / mem01 / tasks
10708
 ```

We set a 512 MB memory limit with this command. Furthermore we already put  *bash shell* process inside  mem01.


 ```shell
aty@ debian: /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mem01# echo $((512*1024*1024)) | tee /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mem01/memory.limit_in_bytes
536870912
```
 
With the command below,  we created a process that wants to use 1G memory. But  it can only use 512M because we enter the value of memory.limit_in_bytes file.

 ```shell
stress -m 1 --vm-bytes 1g --vm-hang 5
 ```
 
Top  command output:

 ```shell
11428 aty 20 0 1052 528 519832 268 R 69.4 52.7 1: 01.80 stress
 ```
